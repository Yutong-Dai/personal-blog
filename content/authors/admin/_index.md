Yutong is a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise) at Lehigh University, working under the supervision of Professor [Daniel P. Robinson](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/danielprobinson/). He also has the fortune to work closely with Professor [Lichao Sun](https://lichao-sun.github.io). 

His current research focuses on 1) designing, analyzing and implementing algorithms for large scale non-convex non-smooth optimization problems arisen in machine learning and federated learning; 2) making machine learning and deep learning algorithms secure, private, and robust.
