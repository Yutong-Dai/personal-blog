Yutong Dai is a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise) at Lehigh University, under the supervision of Professor [Daniel P. Robinson](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/danielprobinson/). He also works closely with Professor [Lichao Sun](https://lichao-sun.github.io). 

His current research interests include
1. designing, analyzing and implementing algorithms for large scale non-convex non-smooth optimization problems arisen in machine learning and federated learning, and
2. making machine learning and deep learning algorithms secure, private, and robust.
