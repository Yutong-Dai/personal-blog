title: Subspace Acceleration Framework For Minimization Involving A Group Sparsity-inducing Regularizer
event: INFORMS2020
event_url: https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9022/session/1013
location: Virtual
summary: Talk about a highly efficient algorithm that solves reguarlized learning problems using second-order acceleration and support prediction techniques.
abstract: "I discuss an optimization framework for solving problems with group sparsity-inducing regularization. Such regularizers include Lasso (L1), group Lasso, and latent group Lasso. The framework computes iterates by optimizing over small dimensional subspaces, thus keeping the cost per iteration relatively low. Theoretical convergence results and numerical tests on various learning problems will be presented."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's [*Slides*](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
