title: Inexact Proximal Gradient Methods with Optimal Support Identification
event: INFORMS2022
event_url: https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10693/presentation/6549
location: Indianapolis, United States
summary: Talk about how to solve the proximal gradient subproblem inexactly with a support identification guarantee.
abstract: "We consider the proximal-gradient method for minimizing an objective function that is the sum of a smooth function and a non-smooth convex function. A feature that distinguishes our work from most in the literature is that we assume that the associated proximal-gradient subproblem does not admit a closed-form solution. To address this challenge, we study two adaptive and implementable termination conditions that dictate how accurately the proximal-gradient subproblem must be solved. We prove that the iteration complexity for the resulting inexact proximal-gradient method to reach an Îµ first-order stationary point is $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$. In addition, using the overlapping group L1 regularizer as an example, we propose a new approach for approximately solving the proximal-gradient subproblem, and then establish the support identification complexity result."
