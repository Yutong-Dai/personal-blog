This is the statistical computing course final project, trying to understand, reporduce and extend some results reported in the paper, [Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00670.pdf).

Three datasets are used here, simulated data, [old faithful](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/=data/faithful.dat) and [imageCLEF](https://www.imageclef.org).

Our final result looks like 

* Simulated data
